Thank you for visiting!

I started this blog with the intention to discuss and dive deeper into topics in higher-level marketing, economics, and social psychology.

The project is oriented towards analyzing technical subject material or case studies and trying to extract from them the most useful conclusions that can be communicated in plain speech. My goal is to make every topic, from the basics of economics to the complex subjects in the overlap between marketing and psychology, easy to understand and fun to read.

## Who Am I?

I'm Relja Jankovic and I'm currently entering my fourth year of BS in the area of work and organizational psychology with previous work experience in project management and data analysis.

My interests vary greatly but are mostly focused on behavioral economics, marketing, and their interactions with personality models and intelligence. Some additional areas in which I'm interested, include the psychology of organizational structures and their relation to productivity, psychometric modeling and quantification of psychological or behavioral traits/actions, and game theory, just to name a few.
