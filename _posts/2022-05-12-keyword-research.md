## Determine Seearch Intent

Search intent represents the need that the users have and is generally represented by the most prominent search results. 

    Ex. if we search for turkey sandwich, the most prominent result will be recipes as google determines the most dominant search intent of the users to be meal preparation. In this case we would need to create a recipe page to be able to compete.

If you want to be able to compete you need to analyze search intent for your keywords and plan your content accordingly.


### Types Of Search Intent

1. Informational
    - Searchers looking for information

            Ex. What is SEO?; Who is the president of the US?; Turkey sandwich recipe;
    - Sites rank on these searches through articles. Modifiers include (how, what, who, where, why, when, learn, example*, list)

2. Navigational
    - Searchers looking for a specific website or a place to go

            Ex. Google analytics login; Sushi restaurants near me; Amazon garden hose;
    - You rank for these queries through your products and shouldn't strive for them as even if you rank you won't receive traffic (due to low CTR)

            Ex. If somebody searches for "Facebook login" and you somehow end up in the top results you still won't get clicks because the vas majority of users only wants to go to Facebook and will ignore your page.

3. Commercial Investigation
    - Searchers looking for a product or service that didn't yet make a final decision

            Ex. "Best of" affiliate posts; Item reviews; Item comparisons;
    
    - It's good to go after these types of searches as they have better conversion results. Modifiers include (best, top, price, review*, etc.)

4. Transactional
    - Searchers looking to buy a specific product

            Ex. Buy nutritional protein; skateboards for sale;
    - Usually reserved for sites that offer that product or service, i.e. if you sell gardening supplies you don't want to target computer electronics related searches.

### 3 C's Of Search Intent

1. Content Type
    - Blog Posts
    - Product Pages
    - Category Pages
2. Content Format
    - Listicle type pages
    - How to's
    - Opinion pieces
    - Step by step tutorials
3. Content angle
    - The dominant selling proposition that the top ranking pages are using.

### Analyzing The SERP

You need to analyze a large number of top ranking results in order to determine the most dominant search intent.

You should analyze the SERP with the following techniques:

1. Organic blue link search results
    - Open google and search for your keyword and take note of the top ranking results
    - Use incognito mode to remove personalized results through google account
    - Try searching from the location where you want to rank (use a VPN if necessary)
    - Go into each one of the pages and look for content intent (what the page content is trying to do)

2. SERP features
    - SERP features are anything that appears in google search results other than the organic blue links (Knowledge packs, Ads, Reviews, etc.)

3. SERP stability vs. volatility
    - If the top ranking pages are constantly changing then the search intent may not be clear.
    - Stable SERPs will be harder to rank for but they are more predictable.



### Problems With Search Intent

1. A lot of "it depends" type of SERPs
2. SERPs change and so does the intent
3. SERPs vary based on your location
4. Peoples interpretation of intent can vary

        Tip: Focus on marching the dominant intent of users and don't overanalyze the intent in unclear cases.

## Keyword Research Tactics

Finding untapped keywords - keyword that still has search demand but is less competitive.

### 1. Look At Competitors Low Competition Topics

- Competitors most trafficked pages show you relevant topics in your niche.

1. List out close competitors pages with the most traffic.
2. Sort them by ranking difficulty from lowest to highest.
3. Compare if the top keyword is the one that the page is actually targeting (You can sometimes see from the URL slug, if not analyze the content a bit)
4. Determine if the traffic received on that post mostly originates from that low difficulty keyword or if it originates from other sources as well (if it does than the keyword is not that relevant)
5. Repeat for multiple competitors

### 2. Identify Unique Keyword Modifiers

- Modifier - add on to a base keyword

        Ex. if your base keyword is "credit cards" then modifiers can be:
        - (Best) credit cards
        - (Top) credit cards
        - Credit cards (2022)

- We want to find modifiers that will alter the search results

        Ex. if you search for "best credit cards" and "best credit cards 2022" the results will be nearly identical but if you compare "best rap albums 2020" and best "rap albums 2000" the results will be significantly different

- Take on of the keywords found by competitor analysis and try to add modifiers that will have lower ranking difficulty 

        Ex. if our competitor ranks for "Best web design company" we could try analyzing "best web design company Colorado" as it has lower difficulty and different results. We can do this for every state or for the most prominent state for our service.

### 3. Look For Uncommon Seeds

- The most common way of keyword research is entering a number of broad seeds into a keyword research tool and find new keyword ideas, however, this approach is implemented by almost all SEOs.

- To separate from others we need to find relevant seeds that are less popular.

1. Find our competitors in a keyword research program and list their pages by targeted keyword
2. Exclude all results that contain the most prominent seeds (in our case that would be web design, websites, SEO, etc.)
3. You will be left with unique ideas that you can use as seeds in later investigations (remember, don't look for keywords but seeds)

### 4. Find "vs" And "review" Keywords At Scale

- Good for affiliates as the searchers are close to the end of their conversion process.

1. Determine close competitive product brands through eCommerce sites. Most of them will have the most prominent brands listed as categories.
2. Use a scraper if too many brands exist to collect individually
3. Do keyword analysis on these brands and filter the keywords to include "vs" or "review*" with asterisk on the end to account for different forms of "review"

## Finding Low Competition Keywords

- 5 step process to find them and determine if they are in fact low competition.

### 1. Brainstorm A List Of Topics

- Finding seed keywords - broad keywords that are related to your niche

        Ex. web design company, website design, SEO, eCommerce website design, website hosting

### 2. Keyword Research Tool

- Expand the topics by generating accompanying keywords relevant to the seeds we already listed

### 3. Filter Keywords For Low Difficulty Scores

- Rank keywords from the least competitive to the most competitive ones

### 4. Check If You Can Match Searcher Intent

- If you're unable to match search intent you won't be able to rank

### 5. Assess If The Query Is Actually Low Difficulty

- If the companies above you are high authority industry leaders it will be hard or impossible to rank above them
- If they are unimportant companies you have a shot, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Can I match the search intent?
2. Check domain reputation to see if you outrank them
    - If there are low DR sites that means that we will be able to penetrate as well
3. Check topical authority
    - Do these sites have lots of content relating to that area in which the keyword is located?
    - If they are then our site needs to be in that area too otherwise we won't be able to outrank them.
    - If they aren't then if our site is we will easily outrank them and if we're not we will compete on equal footing.
4. Check relevance of the top ranking pages
5. Check referring domains

## Keyword Research For Affiliate Marketing Sites

Most important thing is to find keywords with a transactional search intent.

There are 4 types of affiliate keywords:

### 1. General Comparisons
They are easy to recommend products as the customers are close to conversion.

    Ex. Best [product name]

1. Start searching for a broad keyword
2. In the filters include "best" to show us all general comparison articles
3. Sort by keyword difficulty from lowest to highest

These are good for low difficulty products, if we want to target higher demand products we need to find ***Topics that target a specific person or a need***

    Ex. Best [product name] for [user]

### 2. Branded Comparisons
Keywords where searcher wants to compare the differences between two branded products.

Usually have lower search demand but they convert very well as the searcher has narrowed down their decision to a few products.

1. Enter relevant brand names in keyword search
2. Filter the search to include "vs"
3. Figure out if the top ranking sites can be beaten

Tip: it's potentially better to put brand + product name as keyword if the company makes multiple types of products

### 3. Product Comparisons
Detailed products reviews, searchers are very close to converting and are looking for an in depth review.

        Ex. Web Fx Review; Bentobox review;

1. Find brands worth reviewing by going to popular eCommerce sites and looking at the brands they have listed as categories
2. Place those brands in the keyword search
3. Filter the search to include "review*"

### 4. T&A Keywords
Stands for ***trust and authority*** which have low conversions but help build site authority. The previously discussed article types are commercial in nature making it hard to get backlinks.

Their purpose is to:
1. Build trust with your audience
2. Build authirity through links

To find topics:
1. Search for a few seeds related to our topics
2. Filter to include questions "what", "why", etc.
3. Find pages with larger ahrefs KD (not google KD, because ahrefs ranks it based on the amount of links)
4. Analyze backlinks of top linking pages

## Keyword Research For A New Website

### Step 1: Generate Keyword Ideas

1. Use a small number of keyword seeds to generate a starting list in a keyword explorer.
2. Find additional ideas in google autosuggest by searching for your seed
3. Scroll to the bottom of the SERP and see related searches
4. Use google correlate to find correlated keywords
5. Filter to include any one of these keywords
6. Filter to have at least some traffic
7. Rank them by KD from lowest to highest
8. Check the parent topic for listings, if it's the same and if it has a higher KD
9. To get keywords for link building sort KD from highest to lowest

Tip: Don't analyze keywords now, just gather as much as possible.
Tip: Use google trends to find related searches

### Step 2: Identify Search Intent

Find the SI for each of the keywords on our list. If we can't match the intent then we exclude that keyword.

### Step 3: Assess Ranking Difficulty

Look at the following aspects of top ranking pages for a keyword:

1. \# of referring domains
2. Authority of the ranking domains
    - Check the DR
3. Topical relevance of top ranking pages
    - See if their domains are related to the keyword
    - See if the title relates to the primary keyword (if they are not you can be more specific and break through)
4. Looking at traffic potential

### Step 4: Extract Subtopics

By looking at the keyword rankings for top pages you can find clues for related topics.

1. Analyze the keywords for that page for top competitors
2. Set asside the most important ones and use them to formulate other blog posts or subsegments of that post
